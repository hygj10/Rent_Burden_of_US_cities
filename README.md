# Group C: Exploring Rent Burden in US Metropolitan Areas

Final project repo for Group C. You can find our Shiny app [here](https://doruk.shinyapps.io/RentBurden/) or [here](https://dorukkilitcioglu.shinyapps.io/RentBurden/) (we're running a second shinyapps link just in case the first hits the time limit), and our final presentation [here](https://github.com/DS-GA3001-015/Group_C_RentBurden/blob/master/Exploring%20Rent%20Burden%20in%20US%20Metropolitan%20Areas.pdf) or [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y1sRzdbjPTi3kQm0ZX6NStnojbwlxrlcMt4unKQEaR8/edit?usp=sharing).

All our data is under the `data` folder. The process book is under the `Process_Book` folder, and you can open it as both an `.Rmd` file and an HTML file.
