## Chicago

The proportion of rent burdened residents in Chicago rapidly increases up to 2013. Since then, it rapidly decreases, reaching a lower proportion of rent burdened residents than in 2010 by 2016.  Inflation adjusted median rent shows a somewhat flat line. This may insinuate that there may have  been some income status change among renters in Chicago. [Chicago SunTimes](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/chicago-rental-housing-market-shift-more-wealthy-renting-fewer-two-flat-apartment-buildings-depaul-university/) says that there were more higher income tenants renting houses, while the number of low income residents has decreased. They also note that people who first attain good jobs tend to move into the city. These events explain why rent burden has decreased recently even though rent prices have not.
