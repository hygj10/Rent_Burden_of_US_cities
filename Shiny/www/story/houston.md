## Houston

Houston, when compared to other metropolitan areas, has been [relatively affordable](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/09/housing-still-a-problem-in-nola-since-katrina/538371/) for the longest time. However, the low-income households are [disproportionately burdened](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/texanomics/article/Even-in-Houston-low-income-households-11230022.php) by rent prices, as the number of affordable and available units are [among the lowest in the US](https://texashousers.net/2017/03/04/texas-7th-houston-3rd-worst-nationally-among-states-cities-in-housing-affordability-for-poor/). The city experienced one of the most devastating storms in the US history, the Hurricane Harvey, in late 2017. In the aftermath of the storm, the rental unit shortage is expected to [become even more severe](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/09/housing-still-a-problem-in-nola-since-katrina/538371/), which in turn means that the rent burden is expected to [increase](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2017/12/22/256990/housing-costs-increasing-burden-for-houston-renters/).
