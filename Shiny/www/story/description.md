Rent Burden has been one of the primary causes of concern for residents of the US metropolitan areas [since the Great Recession](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2017/01/03/after-the-great-recession-many-low-and-middle-income-households-are-struggling-to-pay-the-rent/) of late 2000s. Over the past few years, the number of cost-burdened households has been decreasing, which you can see from our plots, where those who spend 35% or more of their income are considered burdened and those who spend 50% or more of their income are considered severely burdened. Part of it is the Median Rent Prices, which have remained relatively stable for most major metropolitan areas, but part of it is the steady rise of the [renter income levels](https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/cost-burdened-renters-2017/), fueled by the [rise of the average age in the cities](https://www.ft.com/content/4b3f06aa-3e79-11e8-bcc8-cebcb81f1f90) and [increasing housing prices](https://www.globalpropertyguide.com/North-America/United-States/Price-History), which push potential buyers to become renters.
