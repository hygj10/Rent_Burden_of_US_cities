## New York City

New York City is, perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the highest ranking cities in the country when it comes to rent burden. The rent burden has been steadily increasing over the past few years, and only very recently it seems to have plateaued. The damage, however, is done, as some estimates even place the households with rent burden [above 50%](https://ny.curbed.com/2016/12/15/13967302/new-yorkers-cost-burden-rental-market-apartment-list). The median rent continues to show an upward trend, while wages [fail to keep up](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/8/16/16154956/nyc-rent-prices-wage-increase-comparison) with that trend, and affordable housing developments [continue to elude New York](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170811/REAL_ESTATE/170819974/the-most-rent-burdened-areas-of-new-york-not-getting-any-affordable-housing-housing-developments).
