## Boston

Boston has been seeing a rather rapid increase in rent prices. Fortunately, the wages seem to have kept up with it, as the rent burden has seen a decline in the last couple of years, and rent prices have [started to level off](http://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2017/12/14/boston-rents-jchs). The estimated income necessary in order not to be burdened is [around $120,000](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/the-income-needed-to-pay-rent-in-the-largest-cities). As one of the [primary destinations](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/09/americas-biggest-college-towns/498755/) for college students, this level of income is simply not feasible for some Boston residents. The Mayor has taken steps for affordable housing, but whether or not the move sticks [remains to be seen](https://medium.com/@graceholley/what-does-affordable-mean-in-boston-54786aaabf34).
